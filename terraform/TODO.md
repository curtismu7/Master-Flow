# Release Notes

## v0.0.1-alpha
Initial release

## v0.0.2-alpha
Initial pass at documentation

# TODO
- Move PingOne environment name and other configurable options into Terraform variables
- Document all variables included in `terraform.tfvars`
- Break main.tf into more manageable, logical files (? - Could potentially cause confusion for folks less familiar with TF)
- Update configuration for v1.0 release of Master Flows
- Add ability to create and manage users with the configuration
- Research CJ's python script to handle changes required for Widget flows - can this be integrated into the publishing pipeline to make both use-cases available without additional work/effort?
- Social Login providers - https://pingidentity.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ASA/pages/407765131/Set+Up+Social+Logins+for+PingOne
